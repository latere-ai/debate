# debate

Adversarial review for Claude Code coding sessions. A standalone CLI orchestrator that runs a critic agent (Codex by default) against the diff Claude just wrote, mediates a multi-round cross-examination, and surfaces only what the debate failed to resolve.

**Status: design only.** No code yet. This document is the spec. Implementation is gated on a prior measurement (see [Relationship to upstream research](#relationship-to-upstream-research)).

## What this is

A tool that productizes the debate architecture from [agents-byzantine-tolerance/specs/07-adversarial-debate.md](https://github.com/changkun/agents-byzantine-tolerance/blob/main/specs/07-adversarial-debate.md). The upstream spec 07 measures whether debate works on coding tasks; this repo specifies a tool that bets it does, in a way that fails gracefully if 07's H6 (lazy critic collapses the architecture) bites.

## Goal

When Claude finishes a coding task, run a critic (Codex by default) that produces concrete adversarial comments on the diff. Claude either fixes or defends each comment. Up to N rounds of cross-examination. Unresolved leaves surface to the human at the end as a structured review. The human inspects only what wasn't resolved by debate, not the full output.

## Architecture

- **Proposer (P)** — the Claude Code session that just wrote code. Sees the original task and its own diff.
- **Critic(s) (C₁..Cₖ)** — k independent adversarial agents (Codex by default), each scoped to a different aspect (correctness, security, perf, …). Sees the diff + task context only.
- **Judge** — the human, but only at the end and only on unresolved leaves. Optional LLM-judge mode for triage.
- **Mediator** — a small orchestrator process that routes messages between P and the Cᵢ and tracks per-claim resolution state. This is the actual binary we ship.

### Channel constraint (load-bearing)

**Critic output must reach the proposer as a verbatim user message — no system-prompt wrapping, no skill framing, no slash-command template.** The proposer should react to critic comments the same way it would react to the human pasting a code review: full normal defense behavior, no "I'm in skill mode following steps" override.

This rules out skills, slash commands, and any plugin-layer prompt template as the delivery channel. The mechanism is:

- **Proposer side**: `claude --resume <session-id> -p "<critic output verbatim>"` injects the critic's text as a new user turn into the existing Claude Code session.
- **Critic side**: `codex exec` (or equivalent) takes the proposer's text directly as input. Codex has no equivalent of skills/commands, so this side is naturally clean.

The same constraint applies symmetrically — the proposer's response goes back to the critic verbatim, no orchestrator-side prompt scaffolding beyond what's required to identify whose turn it is.

### Rounds

1. **R0 — Trigger.** Claude finishes a coding task (Stop hook, or manual CLI invocation).
2. **R1 — Attack.** Each Cᵢ produces a structured attack list against the diff. Each attack must name a concrete leaf: `{location, claim, expected violation, reproduction}`. Attacks lacking a reproduction are dropped at parse time, not by the proposer.
3. **R2 — Defense.** P responds to each attack with one of: `concede` (and apply fix), `rebut` (with specific counter-evidence), `push-back` (request clarification — only allowed once per attack).
4. **R3..R(max_turn) — Cross-examination.** Cs respond to defenses; P responds again; per-claim resolution state advances or stalls.
5. **Wrap-up.** Output unresolved-leaves review.

## Build options

The channel constraint above eliminates most of the design space. Anything that wraps the critic's output in framing (skills, slash commands, plugin command templates) is out. What remains:

### Option A — CLI binary only

A standalone `debate` orchestrator. User invokes from terminal after a coding session.

```
debate --max-turn=10 --main claude --side codex --side-count=3 \
       --aspect correctness,security,perf --session-id <claude-session>
```

The CLI uses `claude --resume <id>` to inject critic comments as user turns into the existing Claude Code session, and `codex exec` to run the critic.

- Pro: clean channel (verbatim user-message injection); composable; works in CI; trivially supports more critics.
- Con: not auto-triggered; user must invoke manually after each session.
- Verdict: **this is the primitive.** Build first.

### Option B — CLI + opt-in Stop hook (recommended)

Same CLI as A. Add a Stop hook in `.claude/settings.json` that captures the just-finished session ID and invokes the CLI against it.

- Pro: automatic triggering for users who want it; manual invocation still works.
- Con: requires Stop hook to be able to capture session ID and the CLI to drive `--resume` against a session that just stopped (verify mechanics in a spike before committing).
- Verdict: **recommended once A works.** Hook is two lines of shell that calls the CLI; no plugin, no skill, no slash command.

### Rejected options

- **Slash command (`/debate`)**: violates the channel constraint — slash commands inject a template into the conversation. Even if the template only said "run the debate process," that's still a system-prompt-shaped artifact the proposer sees before the critic's text.
- **Skill (`debate-review` or `debate-defense`)**: same reason. Skills carry instructions Claude follows. The whole point is that Claude follows its *normal* coding-feedback instincts when responding to the critic, not a skill-specific methodology.
- **Plugin packaging**: premature productization. A two-line hook + a CLI binary doesn't need a plugin manifest. Revisit if a second user shows up.

## CLI surface

```
debate [--main claude] [--side codex] [--side-count 1]
       [--max-turn 6] [--aspect general]
       [--session-id <claude-session-id>]
       [--diff-from HEAD] [--diff-to .]
       [--task-context "<original task>"]
       [--judge none|llm|human]
       [--cost-cap 50000]
       [--state-dir .debate]
       [--format markdown|json]
```

Notes:

- `--session-id` is the load-bearing flag. When given, the orchestrator drives the proposer with `claude --resume <id> -p "<critic-output-verbatim>"` each round. Without it, the orchestrator falls back to fresh `claude -p` invocations per round (more expensive, no session continuity).
- `--side-count` and `--aspect` interact: if `--aspect a,b,c` is given with `--side-count 3`, each critic gets one aspect. If counts mismatch, error.
- `--max-turn` counts P+C exchanges combined. 6 = 3 attack rounds + 3 defense rounds.
- `--task-context` is mandatory when no `--session-id` is given (critic without task context produces irrelevant attacks). With `--session-id`, the orchestrator can extract the original task from the session's first user turn.
- `--cost-cap` is mandatory and aborts gracefully (surfaces partial review). Multi-critic multi-turn debates blow token budgets fast.
- Exit code 0 if zero unresolved leaves, 1 otherwise. Lets it gate CI.

## Hook surface (optional)

A single Stop hook entry in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [{
      "command": "debate --session-id $CLAUDE_SESSION_ID --max-turn 6"
    }]
  }
}
```

That's it. No plugin manifest, no slash command, no skill. The hook is two lines because all the work is in the CLI. Default: hook is **not installed**; users opt in by adding the entry.

## Session persistence

Each debate run is a session with explicit start and end markers and an on-disk record. This is what makes the orchestrator auditable and the "review unresolved later" workflow possible.

### Layout

Each invocation creates a folder under `--state-dir` (default `.debate/`):

```
.debate/
  log.jsonl                 # one line per debate run, appended at end
  sessions/
    <ISO8601>-<short-id>/
      start.json            # timestamp, claude-session-id, task-context, diff snapshot, config
      transcript.jsonl      # append-only: each round's messages, structured
      attacks.jsonl         # per-attack records: id, location, status, rounds_survived, re_attacked
      summary.md            # human-facing summary, written at termination
      end.json              # termination condition, stats, exit code
```

### Lifecycle invariants the orchestrator must enforce

- `start.json` written atomically before any agent process spawns.
- `transcript.jsonl` and `attacks.jsonl` are append-only — never rewrite, never seek-back. A killed process leaves a valid (truncated) record.
- `summary.md` and `end.json` are written only at clean termination.
- `log.jsonl` is appended last, after `end.json` is durable. A run with `end.json` missing is an interrupted session; user can inspect `transcript.jsonl` directly.

### Surfacing rule

- **Zero unresolved leaves at termination**: orchestrator is silent on stdout except for one line referencing the `log.jsonl` entry. No summary file is opened or surfaced. `summary.md` is still written for audit, but the user is not interrupted.
- **≥ 1 unresolved leaves**: orchestrator prints the path to `summary.md` plus the *headline contradicting signal* (see below) on stdout. Exit code 1.
- **Interrupted (Ctrl-C, cost-cap, malformed-output)**: same as ≥ 1 unresolved — surface what's there.

### Headline contradicting signal

Among unresolved leaves, the headline is the attack with the highest **contention score**:

```
contention(attack) = rounds_survived + (1 if critic re_attacked_after_defense else 0)
```

Tie-break by first appearance. This is deliberately a cheap rule with no LLM scoring — adding semantic-scoring would re-introduce the lazy-judge problem at the headline step. If contention turns out to be a poor proxy in practice, upgrade later by having both sides self-report confidence each round and weighting by `confidence_critic × confidence_proposer`.

### `.gitignore`

`.debate/` should not be committed. Orchestrator checks `.gitignore` on first run and prints a warning (not a hard error) if `.debate/` is missing from it. Doesn't auto-edit the file — that's the user's call.

## Configuration

Project-level `.debate.toml` overrides defaults:

```toml
max_turn = 6
side_count = 2
aspects = ["correctness", "security"]
cost_cap_tokens = 50000
trigger = "manual"           # "manual" | "stop"
allow_style_attacks = false  # default: critic must attack behavior, not style
```

## Termination conditions

The mediator terminates and writes `summary.md` + `end.json` when any of these fire:

1. **Steady state** — no new attacks two rounds running.
2. **Max turn** — hard cap reached.
3. **Cost cap** — token budget hit.
4. **Malformed output** — critic produces ill-formed attacks two rounds running (defensive: model is broken or prompt collapsed).
5. **User interrupt** — Ctrl-C; the orchestrator's signal handler still writes `end.json` before exiting.

The summary header names which condition fired, so the human knows whether to trust "0 unresolved" (steady state) or treat it as truncation (max-turn / cost-cap). Only steady-state termination with zero unresolved is "clean" — every other condition surfaces.

## Output format

`summary.md` structure:

```
# Debate review — terminated: steady-state | max-turn | cost-cap | interrupted

## Headline (most contested unresolved)
- [security/api.py:88] Input sanitization
  - Critic: framework auto-escape doesn't cover `LIKE` patterns.
  - Proposer: parameterized via SQLAlchemy.
  - **Stake**: input `'; DROP TABLE--%` against the search endpoint.
  - Contention: 3 rounds survived, critic re-attacked after defense.

## Other unresolved (2, sorted by contention)
- ...

## Resolved (12)
- [conceded] Off-by-one in pagination loop → fixed at src/api.py:42
- [rebutted] Race condition claim → critic withdrew after seeing lock at api.py:18

## Stats
critic-found-real-issue rate: 7/15 attacks led to a fix
debate cost: 38k tokens, 6 turns, 2 critics
session: .debate/sessions/2026-05-05T14-22-31-a3f9b1/
```

When unresolved count is zero, `summary.md` still has the Resolved + Stats sections (no Headline, no Unresolved) and is written but not surfaced. The user only sees one line on stdout pointing at `.debate/log.jsonl`.

The Headline section is the entire justification for the tool. If it's noise across many sessions, the tool fails — and the cross-session `log.jsonl` makes that measurable rather than vibes-based. The Stats block lets the user spot-check whether the critic is actually working: if `critic-found-real-issue rate` trends near 0, disable the hook.

## Risks

- **Lazy-critic risk (the binding one).** This is upstream spec 07's H6. Codex may rubber-stamp. **Mitigation**: do not ship the tool until upstream 07a (bug detection, deterministic judge) returns critic-found-bug rate ≥ 60% on seeded bugs. If it's below 30%, this whole project is dead on arrival.
- **Cost.** Multi-critic multi-turn debates 5–10x a coding session's token bill. Cost cap is mandatory; default it conservatively (50k tokens).
- **Flow disruption.** Auto-Stop on every completion is annoying for trivial edits. Default trigger is `manual`; auto is opt-in. Consider a `--changed-lines-min N` filter (only debate if diff is non-trivial).
- **Critic context starvation.** Critic only sees diff + task context, not the broader codebase. Produces false-positive attacks ("this function isn't called!" — yes it is, elsewhere). Mitigations: critic prompt requires concrete reproduction, and the proposer is allowed to rebut with `file:line` references the critic is forbidden from re-attacking.
- **Stylistic-gripe drift.** Critic attacks style not behavior. `allow_style_attacks = false` enforces it in the critic prompt; mediator drops style-shaped attacks at parse time.
- **Asymmetric truth.** Proposer has more context than critic; may over-defend when actually wrong. Mitigation: `--judge llm` mode triages unresolved leaves; default `none` just surfaces them and trusts the human.
- **Critic colludes with proposer.** If critic and proposer share a model family, they're more likely to agree on the same wrong answer. **Heterogeneity is structural here, not optional** — Claude proposer + Codex critic is the default for a reason. Don't ship a Claude-vs-Claude default.

## Out of scope

- **Skill or slash-command entry points.** Both wrap critic output in framing that distorts the proposer's response. The channel constraint says verbatim user-message via `claude --resume` only.
- **Plugin packaging.** Two-line hook + CLI binary doesn't need a manifest. Revisit only if multiple unrelated users adopt it.
- Training a better critic. Use whatever Codex gives us; if it's bad, the tool fails (and that's the right outcome).
- Streaming TUI. v1 is batch.
- Persistent debate state across sessions. Each invocation is fresh against the current diff.
- Critic tool access beyond reading the diff and the task context. Deliberate — keeps the critic narrow and prevents critic-rabbit-holes.
- Auto-applying critic-suggested fixes. Concession-fixes are written by the proposer, not the critic. The critic never edits.

## Relationship to upstream research

This tool is the productization of the debate architecture studied in [agents-byzantine-tolerance](https://github.com/changkun/agents-byzantine-tolerance). Specifically it bets on the architecture from [spec 07](https://github.com/changkun/agents-byzantine-tolerance/blob/main/specs/07-adversarial-debate.md) and inherits its risks.

**This tool should not be built before upstream spec 07a returns positive on H1 (debate beats voting at equal compute) and not-bitten on H6 (lazy critic).** Order of work:

1. Run upstream 07a (bug detection, deterministic judge, 2-player honest debate) — measure critic-found-bug rate.
2. If ≥ 60%: build this repo's CLI orchestrator (Option A).
3. If 07a also shows H1 holds: add the Stop hook (Option B).
4. If 07's H6 bites (lazy critic): re-prompt critic, re-measure; if still bad, abandon the tool.

This ordering means the tool is gated on a real measurement, not a hope.
