# agon

Adversarial review for Claude Code coding sessions.

After Claude finishes a task, `agon` forks the session for one or
more critic agents (Codex by default), runs a multi-round
cross-examination per critic, applies any concessions the proposer
makes, and surfaces only the unresolved disputes for human attention.
Each critic picks its own attack topic in round 1 (security, perf,
internal-consistency, evidence-gap, ...); later critics are told
which topics are taken and pick something else. No agon content
ever lands in the root Claude session - agon happens in branched
forks off the root.

Design and per-component contracts live under [specs/](specs/) -
start at [specs/README.md](specs/README.md) for the index.
Release-cut evidence (probe outcomes, smoke recordings) is committed
to [release-notes-v0.0.1.md](release-notes-v0.0.1.md).

## Installation

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/latere-ai/agon/main/install.sh | sh
```

The script detects your OS / arch, fetches the latest release tarball
from
[github.com/latere-ai/agon/releases](https://github.com/latere-ai/agon/releases),
verifies the sha256 checksum, installs `agon` to `/usr/local/bin`
(via `sudo` if needed), and runs `agon install-hook --scope user`.
Knobs:

```sh
AGON_VERSION=v0.0.1-rc2  # pin a specific tag; default: latest
AGON_PREFIX=$HOME/.local # binary lands at $AGON_PREFIX/bin
AGON_NO_HOOK=1           # skip the install-hook step
```

From source (requires Go 1.26+):

```sh
go install latere.ai/x/agon/cmd/agon@latest
agon install-hook --scope user
```

`install-hook` merges the verbose-format Stop hook entry into
`~/.claude/settings.json` (or `./.claude/settings.json` with `--scope
project`). The entry is `<path-to>/agon hook` — a built-in
subcommand of the binary, so no separate shell script needs to be on
PATH. `uninstall-hook` removes it.

## Example usage

With the Stop hook installed, agon runs automatically when claude
finishes responding. You see one stdout line; the summary lives on
disk:

```text
$ # ...claude does its thing...
[agon] 2 unresolved; see /repo/.agon/sessions/20260506T140905Z-q3a9f1/summary.md

$ cat .agon/sessions/*/summary.md
# Agon review - terminated: steady-state

## Headline (most contested unresolved)
- [security/api.go:88] SQL injection via unparameterized LIKE
  - Critic: framework auto-escape doesn't cover LIKE patterns
  - Proposer: parameterized via SQLAlchemy
  - **Stake**: GET /search?q=%' OR 1=1--
  - Contention: 3 (re-attacked: true)

## Resolved (5)
- [conceded] Off-by-one in pagination → fixed at api.go:42
...

## Stats
critic-found-bug rate: 5/8 attacks led to a fix
agon cost: 38k tokens, 6 rounds, 4 critics
```

Trivial diffs (under `--changed-lines-min`, default 10) short-circuit
in milliseconds. No session folder, just one `kind:"skipped"` line in
`.agon/log.jsonl`.

### Run it on demand

There is no in-editor manual trigger: a slash command, skill, or
`UserPromptSubmit` sentinel all mutate the root transcript (probed -
see `specs/36-probe-userpromptsubmit-manual-trigger.md`). The
byte-identical way to trigger on demand is to run agon yourself in a
terminal - it only touches the live session via `--fork-session`, so
your Claude Code transcript is untouched, exactly as under the Stop
hook. This is also the path for CI gating, scripted batch runs, and
reviewing a saved session:

```sh
agon \
  --session-id <root-claude-session-id> \
  --side-count 4 \
  --max-turn 6
```

A shell alias keeps it one keystroke away (agon resolves the latest
session for the cwd when `--session-id` is omitted):

```sh
alias agon-attack='agon --side-count 4 --max-turn 6'
```

Each of the four critics picks its own topic in R1; the orchestrator
passes prior critics' topics to each later critic as anti-duplication
signal. `agon --help` lists every flag. Exit codes: 0 clean,
1 unresolved leaves, 130 interrupted, 100s pre-flight failure.

Five load-bearing pieces (full design in
[spec 01](specs/01-overview.md)):

- **Forked agon, no agon content in root.** Each critic gets its
  own claude fork via `--fork-session`. The user's root transcript
  never sees a agon turn. Probe-confirmed against claude 2.1.131:
  a no-output Stop hook produces zero `hook_*` attachments, so the
  invariant holds across modes including the Stop-hook path. See
  [specs/28](specs/28-probe-no-output-stop-hook-outcome.md).
- **Verbatim channel.** Critic output reaches the proposer-clone as a
  plain user turn pointing at a file: `Some comments at @<path>.
  Please resolve or respond.` No skill, slash-command, or
  plugin-template wrapping that would distort the proposer's normal
  defense behavior.
- **Self-declared topics.** Each critic chooses its own attack topic
  in R1 (security, perf, internal-consistency, evidence-gap, ...) and
  later critics are told which topics are already claimed so they
  pick something else. No fixed catalog. The debate-theoretic
  property - one competent honest player suffices for soundness -
  means a lazy critic on one topic doesn't break the others.
- **Persisted ledger.** Every attack carries a stable id (`c<critic>-<seq>`),
  every transition is appended to `attacks.jsonl`. Headlines are
  picked by a pure contention score (`rounds_survived + (1 if
  re-attacked)`) - no LLM judging at this layer.
- **Best-effort critic isolation.** v0 enforces "artifact + task
  only" by critic system prompt and `codex --sandbox read-only`, not
  OS isolation; strict per-fork sandbox dirs are v1.
